This is a lightly modified version of
http://b2ben.blogspot.com/2011/02/diving-into-microcontrollers-my-tiny.html for
Arduino.  Build a 5x4 charlieplex per his instructions and plug it in to pins 2,
3, 4, 5 and 6.

If you build this for another Arduino or use different pins, you'll need to
update the DDRD and PORTD calls in light_led(); Dig up your AVR schematic and
make sure your pins are all on the same set of ports, otherwise I'm not sure how
you'd deal with it.

I've included a Fritzing file of the breadboard if you want to build it as a
proof of concept before pulling out your soldering iron.  The broad gist of it
is that pins 1, 6, 11, 16 and 21 are all common anodes.  Make a bus on the other
side of the breadboard for that anode, and then you run jumpers from every
cathode to every anode's bus, excepting the cathode for the current LED's anode.

My assembly notes are as follows:

1 = pin A
6 = pin B
11 = pin C
16 = pin D
21 = pin E

pin 1 = A+ 
pin 2 = 0- goes to E
pin 3 = 5- goes to D
pin 4 = 10- goes to C
pin 5 = 15- goes to B
pin 6 = B+
pin 7 = 1- goes to E
pin 8 = 6- goes to D
pin 9 = 11- goes to C
pin 10 = 16- goes to A
pin 11 = C+
pin 12 = 2- goes to E
pin 13 = 7- goes to D
pin 14 = 12- goes to B
pin 15 = 17- goes to A
pin 16 = D+
pin 17 = 3- goes to E
pin 18 = 8- goes to C
pin 19 = 13- goes to B
pin 20 = 18- goes to A
pin 21 = E+
pin 22 = 4- goes to D
pin 23 = 9- goes to C
pin 24 = 14- goes to B
pin 25 = 19- goes to A

 0  1  2  3 - E bus
 4  5  6  7 - D bus
 8  9 10 11 - C bus
12 13 14 15 - B bus
16 17 18 19 - A bus
